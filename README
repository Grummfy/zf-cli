This is a command-line interface to Zend Framework application in its simple form.

Go to the bin directory and execute: `php cli.php`
This will execute index action in index controller from application/controllers-cli/IndexController.php

`php cli.php index info` will execute info action in index controller.

Everything is pretty self-explanatory.
